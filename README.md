Flutter plugin to support Android and iOS push notifications from [https://iterable.com/](https://iterable.com/).

## Usage
To use this plugin, add `iterable_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

### Supported methods
| Method | Android | iOS | Web |
|---|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | X | X | |
| `setEmail` | X | X | |
| `setUserId` | X | X | |
| `registerForPush` | X | X | |
| `updateUser` | X | X | |
| `signOut` | X | X | |
| `track` | X | X | |
| `setNotificationOpenedHandler` | X | X | |

## Installation
1. Add `iterable_flutter` as a plugin in `pubspec.yaml` file like this:
```yaml
iterable_flutter:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/la-haus/iterable-flutter.git
    ref: 0.1.0 # Version that you want
```

2. Use `IterableFlutter.initialize` to set your iterable keys.
> First, create a mobile API Key from [Iterable](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043464871#creating-api-keys). 
> Then, also from Iterable, [create a mobile app](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000331943#_2-create-a-mobile-app-in-iterable) and [assign a push integration](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000331943#_3-assign-a-push-integration-to-the-mobile-app)
to it.
```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    IterableFlutter.initialize(
      apiKey: <api-key>,
      pushIntegrationName: <name>,
    );
  }
}
```

3. Identify the user
> The identification can be done either using `IterableFlutter.setEmail` or `IterableFlutter.setUserId` methods. 
> Don't set an email and user ID in the same session, doing so causes the SDK to treat them as different users.

4. Call `IterableFlutter.registerForPush` to register the device for current user and listen for opened pushes with `IterableFlutter.setNotificationOpenedHandler`

5. Track your events, call `IterableFlutter.track` method.
